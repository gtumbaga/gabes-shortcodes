# gabes-shortcodes
---
This is my custom WP plugin that allows me to have listing pages for the posts, for a category of my choosing.
The idea, is to put the shortcode into any page template you want, in order to be able to use any URL you want for each listout page.
This is my custom child theme created to modify the twenty-twenty theme how I want it.
